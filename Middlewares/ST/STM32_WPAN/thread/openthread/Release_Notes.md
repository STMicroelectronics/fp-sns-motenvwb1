Thread overview
===============

Thread is an IPV6-based,royalty-free networking protocol for Internet of
Things (Iot). This protocol is mainly used on "smart" home automation
devices to communicate on a local wireless mesh network. Thread uses
6LoWPAN, which in turn uses the IEE 802.15.4 wireless protocol.

The Thread stack contains several layers as shown on the figure below:

OpenThread Stack
================

-   The Thread stack running on the STM32WB device is provided by
    OpenThread and available at :
    <https://github.com/openthread/openthread>

-   OpenThread released by Nest is an open-source implementation of the
    Thread networking protocol. To learn more about this stack, refer
    yourself to the following link: <https://openthread.io>
